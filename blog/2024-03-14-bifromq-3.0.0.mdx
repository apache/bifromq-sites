We're excited to unveil the beta [release](https://github.com/bifromqio/bifromq/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta.1) of BifroMQ 3.0.0, a milestone that signifies major progress in the BifroMQ project. This latest version introduces an array of new
features aimed at enhancing the messaging experience, with full adoption of the MQTT 5.0 standard. It's important to note that BifroMQ 3.0.0 introduces groundbreaking changes, making it incompatible with data from previous versions. The
plugin interface has also been upgraded to support MQTT 5.0 functionalities, which means it cannot support direct rolling upgrades from older versions.

**Key Features of BifroMQ 3.0.0:**

- **Full Support for MQTT 5.0:** Explore the new capabilities of MQTT 5, including SharedSubscription, TopicAlias, SubscriptionIdentifier, FlowControl, EnhancedAuthentication, SessionExpiry, WillDelay, and more, designed to meet all your
  messaging needs.

- **Enhanced Observability of Tenant Loads:** The latest version offers improved observability into tenant loads via [Tenant Metrics](/docs/admin_guide/observability/metrics/intro/), providing timely and accurate insights into each tenant's
  resource usage.

- **Tenant-Level Real-Time Resource Limitation:** A new plugin type, the [Resource Throttler](/docs/plugin/resource_throttler/), has been introduced to facilitate tenant-level resource limitation. This feature simplifies the implementation
  of resource and load isolation in multi-tenant systems.

- **Improved API Usability:** Significant enhancements have been made to [API usability](/docs/user_guide/api/intro/), making it easier for users to interact with BifroMQ.

- **Backpressure Protection:** This feature aims to ensure system stability and reliability by protecting against overload.

In addition to functional upgrades, the official [documentation](/docs/get_started/intro/) has been comprehensively updated for clarity and depth.

We encourage you to download, test, and provide feedback on this beta version of BifroMQ 3.0.0. Your insights are invaluable as we continue to improve and expand BifroMQ, aiming to offer the most robust and feature-rich messaging solution
available.
