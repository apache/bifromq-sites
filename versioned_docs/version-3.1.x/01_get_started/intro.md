BifroMQ is a Java-based, high-performance, distributed MQTT broker implementation that seamlessly integrates native multi-tenancy support. It is designed to facilitate the building of large-scale IoT device connections and messaging
systems. Presently, BifroMQ serves as the foundational technology for [Baidu IoTCore](https://cloud.baidu.com/product/iot.html), a public serverless cloud service.

## Origin of the Name

BifroMQ derives its name from the Norse mythological `Bifröst`, a rainbow bridge that connects Midgard (the realm of humans) and Asgard (the domain of gods). Like Bifröst, BifroMQ serves as a flexible and sturdy bridge, linking different
systems or applications to enable communication through message exchange. This aligns with the core function of MQTT middleware, which is to manage and accelerate message delivery in distributed systems.

The robustness of Bifröst symbolizes BifroMQ's stability and reliability, while its flexibility signifies BifroMQ's scalability and adaptability. In a nutshell, "BifroMQ" epitomizes resilient, adaptable MQTT middleware that interconnects
various systems or applications.
