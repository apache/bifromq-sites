## Contribute Code to Apache BifroMQ (Incubating)

We appreciate your interest in contributing code to Apache BifroMQ (Incubating)! This guide will walk you through the process of proposing, developing, and submitting code changes to the project.

Whether you're fixing a bug, implementing a new feature, or improving test coverage, the BifroMQ community is here to support your contribution.


### 1. Find or Propose an Issue

Before writing any code, we recommend the following:

* **Check for Existing Issues:** Browse open issues in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/apache/bifromq/issues) to see if someone is already working on the task.
* **Propose a New Issue:** If your idea is new, open an issue describing the problem or feature clearly. Include motivation, background, and potential approaches.

> 📬 For larger changes, it's a good idea to discuss your proposal on the [dev@bifromq.apache.org](mailto:dev@bifromq.apache.org) mailing list before starting implementation.


### 2. Work on the Code

Once an issue is assigned to you or you’ve received a green light from the community:

#### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apache/bifromq.git
cd bifromq
```

#### Follow Coding Guidelines

Please follow BifroMQ’s:

* Code style conventions (Java)
* Commit message format (`[Component] Description`)

> ✅ Tip: Include meaningful tests for your changes and ensure existing tests pass.


### 3. Submit a Pull Request (PR)

Once your changes are ready:

* Push your branch to your fork
* Open a Pull Request against the target branch
* Reference the corresponding issue in the PR description (e.g., “Fixes #123”)
* Include a clear summary of the changes and motivation


### 4. Address Review Feedback

During the review phase:

* Engage constructively with feedback
* Revise your code as needed
* Rebase your branch to keep the commit history clean

Once your PR is approved, a committer will merge it. Congratulations! 🎉


### 5. Merge change

The code will be merged by a committer once the review is finished.
