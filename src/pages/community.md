# BifroMQ Community

As an open-source project, BifroMQ warmly welcomes developers and enterprises to actively participate in project development and enhancement. To facilitate this, we have provided an abundance of resources such as documentation, tutorials, Q&A, and code contributions on the [BifroMQ official website](https://bifromq.apache.org/) and the [GitHub community platform](https://github.com/apache/bifromq)

Additionally, you can also join our [Discord group](https://discord.gg/Pfs3QRadRB).

# Mailing List

## About the Mailing List

The BifroMQ mailing lists are the primary channels for open, public discussions within the community. Subscribing allows you to:

- Stay informed about bug reports and feature requests
- Participate in discussions about development plans and specific issues
- Offer help to users who ask questions via email
- Follow project updates and progress

For reporting specific bugs or requesting new features, we recommend using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/apache/bifromq/issues).
For broader technical discussions or proposals, please use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/apache/bifromq/discussions), which is often a more efficient way to collaborate.

### Mailing List Types
