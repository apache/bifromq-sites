## Contribute to Documentation

Great documentation is essential to the success of Apache BifroMQ (Incubating). Whether you're correcting a typo, improving clarity, or adding new tutorials, your contributions help make BifroMQ more accessible and usable for everyone — from first-time users to advanced developers.

We welcome and encourage all kinds of documentation improvements!


### 📄 What You Can Contribute

Here are some ways you can help improve the documentation:

* Fix typos, grammar, or formatting issues
* Clarify instructions or explanations
* Update outdated content
* Add new sections (e.g., feature usage, configuration examples, deployment tips)
* Improve the structure or navigation
* Translate content (when relevant)
* Update or improve the project website

No contribution is too small — even fixing a broken link makes a difference!


### 🛠️ How the Documentation is Organized

BifroMQ’s documentation is hosted in the main [GitHub repository](https://github.com/apache/bifromq-sites) under:

```
docs/
```

* `docs/` contains technical guides, usage examples, and system architecture.


### 🧑‍💻 How to Contribute Documentation

   Fork [bifromq-sites](https://github.com/apache/bifromq-sites) to your own GitHub account.

   git checkout -b feat-xyz
   ```

3. **Edit or Add Content**

    * Use Markdown for most files.
    * Follow the existing writing style and structure.
    * Preview locally if making website changes (e.g., using `npm install` then running `npm start`).

4. **Open a Pull Request**

    * Push your branch and open a PR targeting the `master` branch.
    * Use a clear title like: `[Docs] Clarify broker configuration options`.
    * Explain what you changed and why.


### ✍️ Writing Guidelines
