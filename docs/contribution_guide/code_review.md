## Review a Pull Request

Code reviews are critical to the quality, stability, and long-term maintainability of Apache BifroMQ (Incubating). As a community-driven project, we welcome everyone — not just committers — to participate in reviewing code. Whether you're new or experienced, your feedback helps improve contributions and shares knowledge across the community.

Here’s how you can effectively review a Pull Request (PR) in BifroMQ:


### 1. Understand the Context

Before diving into the code:

* **Read the PR description carefully.** Understand what problem the change solves and how.
* **Check the linked issue**, if any. This gives insight into the motivation, discussion history, and design considerations.
* **Scan the commit message(s)** to ensure they follow the project’s format and are descriptive.


### 2. Review Checklist

While reviewing, consider the following:

#### ✅ Correctness

* Does the code behave as described?
* Are edge cases handled properly?
* Is it backwards-compatible?

#### 🧪 Test Coverage

* Are there new or updated tests that cover the change?
* Do tests pass locally or in CI?

#### 💻 Code Quality

* Is the code clear and easy to understand?
* Are any parts overly complex or in need of refactoring?
* Does the code follow BifroMQ’s style and conventions?

#### 📁 Design & Architecture

* Does the change align with the existing architecture?
* Could it introduce unnecessary coupling, duplication, or inefficiency?

#### 📄 Documentation

* Are code comments helpful and accurate?
* For user-facing changes, is documentation updated where applicable?


### 3. Give Constructive Feedback

Use GitHub’s review tools to:

* Ask clarifying questions
* Suggest improvements
* Point out potential bugs
* Praise good practices and elegant solutions

Be respectful and collaborative — we strive to foster a supportive and inclusive community. Assume positive intent and focus on shared learning and improvement.


### 4. Approve or Request Changes

Once you’re done reviewing:

* If the PR meets the quality bar, approve it.
* If changes are needed, submit a review with comments and select **“Request changes”**.
* If you're not sure, leave comments and mark the review as **“Comment only”** — others can follow up.


### 5. Follow Up

After leaving your review:

* Stay engaged if the author responds with updates or questions.
* Re-review the PR after updates and adjust your review status if needed.


### Tips for New Reviewers

* Start by reviewing small PRs — even reviewing spelling fixes or test cases helps.
* Learn from how others review — committers’ comments often reflect good patterns.
* Don’t be afraid to ask questions or admit you’re unsure — it’s part of growing in open-source.
