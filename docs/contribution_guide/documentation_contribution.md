## Contribute to Documentation

We welcome and encourage all kinds of documentation improvements.

### What You Can Contribute

Here are some ways you can help improve the documentation:

- Fix typos, grammar, or formatting issues
- Clarify instructions or explanations
- Update outdated content
- Add new sections (e.g., feature usage, configuration examples, deployment tips)
- Improve the structure or navigation
- Translate content (when relevant)
- Update or improve the project website

No contribution is too small — even fixing a broken link makes a difference!

### How the Documentation is Organized

BifroMQ’s documentation is hosted in the main [GitHub repository](https://github.com/apache/bifromq-sites) under: `docs/`

- `docs/` contains technical guides, usage examples, and system architecture.

### How to Contribute Documentation

1. **Fork the Repository**

   Fork [bifromq-sites](https://github.com/apache/bifromq-sites) to your own GitHub account.

2. **Create a Branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat-xyz
   ```

3. **Edit or Add Content**
   - Use Markdown for most files.
   - Follow the existing writing style and structure.
   - Preview locally if making website changes (e.g., using `npm install` then running `npm start`).

4. **Open a Pull Request**
   - Push your branch and open a PR targeting the `master` branch.
   - Use a clear title like: `[Docs] Clarify broker configuration options`.
   - Explain what you changed and why.

### Writing Guidelines

- Use clear, concise language.
- Favor practical examples and command-line snippets.
- Be consistent in tone (neutral and helpful).
- Link to relevant code or external references when useful.
