BifroMQ utilizes the standard SLF4J interface for logging purposes and selects Logback as its logging backend. The logs are organized into five distinct levels: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, and ERROR, with INFO set as the default log level.

### Logback Configuration File

The logback configuration file, named `logback.xml`, is located in the `conf` directory within the BifroMQ installation folder. This file allows for detailed customization of logging behavior, including log level settings, output formats, and file rotation policies.

### Log Directories

By default, BifroMQ stores log files in the `log` directory found in the installation folder. If necessary, an alternative logging directory can be designated by setting the `LOG_DIR` environment variable. 

### Plugin Logging

Plugin implementors can also leverage the standard SLF4J interface for logging. This means logs generated by plugins can be managed and configured just like the main system logs through the same logback configuration file. This unified approach to logging simplifies the management of log files and ensures consistency across the system and its extensions.
