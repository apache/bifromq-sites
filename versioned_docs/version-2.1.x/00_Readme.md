# BifroMQ

BifroMQ is a Java-based high-performance, distributed MQTT broker implementation that seamlessly integrates native multi-tenancy
support. It is designed to support building large-scale IoT device connections and messaging systems. Presently, BifroMQ serves as the foundational technology for [Baidu IoTCore](https://cloud.baidu.com/product/iot.html), a public serverless
cloud service.

## Origin of the Name

BifroMQ derives its name from the Norse mythological `Bifröst`, a rainbow bridge that connects Midgard (the realm of humans) and Asgard (the domain of gods). Like Bifröst, BifroMQ serves as a flexible and sturdy bridge linking different systems or applications to enable communication through message exchange. This aligns with the core function of MQTT middleware, which is to manage and accelerate message delivery in distributed systems.

The robustness of Bifröst is emblematic of BifroMQ's stability and reliability, while its pliability signifies BifroMQ's scalability and adaptability. In a nutshell, "BifroMQ" epitomizes a resilient, adaptable MQTT middleware that interconnects various systems or applications.
