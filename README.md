# Apache BifroMQ (Incubating) Documentation

Apache BifroMQ is currently undergoing incubation at the Apache Software Foundation.

This repository is for [Apache BifroMQ](https://bifromq.apache.org/) documentations and blogs.
The website is built on [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/) which is a modern static website generator.

## Disclaimer

Apache BifroMQ is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
